        We can use a CSS pseudo-class to also target a certain element on a page based upon its
        position on the page.<br/> For instance, if we want to select the first item, or the last item, or some
        specific number in a list of items we can do so by using the CSS nth child pseudo-class. There
        are several different CSS properties related to the nth child.
